            <h2>Ginger</h2>
            <h3>Female/Spayed</h3>
            <h3>15 years</h3>
            <p>	
                Ginger is a senior kitty hoping to find her retirement home. She's 15 years-old and she's petite at only 7 lbs., She's only here due to her owner passing away, and she previously lived with 6 cats. We're currently determining whether the cats are bonded to each other so anyone wishing to adopt prior to the conclusion of our Bonded Protocol will need to adopt Paws and Ginger together, as they are, at the least, extremely close friends. Ginger grew up around children and likes them, and she enjoys being able to go outside when the weather is nice.
                
                She's a quiet and friendly cat that deserves to live in a warm, comfortable and quiet home rather than in a shelter, with its attendant noise, smells and commotion, and she will be eternally grateful to anyone who gives her that chance.</p>

            <h3>Male/Neutered</h3>

            <h2>Addison</h2>
            <h3>Female/Spayed</h3>
            <h3>3 years</h3>
            <p>	
                Addison is a very pretty gray lady, but she's only 3, so the coat is just for looks. She's a huge fan of people and cat-watching, so if you have a window where she can perch, it will likely be where she'll spend a lot of time. She seems to enjoy swatting at pipe cleaners, so you'll have lots of fun trying out new toys with her to see if she turns into a kitten again.
                
                Addison is already spayed, so she's ready to head right home with the lucky person who adopts her, and she hopes she doesn't have to wait too long, since a home would be so much more interesting than the cattery.
                
                If she sounds like your kind of Tabby, come meet her today!</p>

            <h2>Alaska</h2>
            <h3>Male/neutered</h3>
            <h3>9 years</h3>
            <p>	Alaska's unique appearance with cream color and dark orange ears makes him stand out from the crowd. He's a 9 year-old independent cat who would love to relax and hang around near you, but doesn't have to be in your lap all the time. If given the chance Alaska would sit by the window for hours and watch as the birds and cars go by, and perhaps catch a nice nap in the warm sunshine. If you give Alaska a chance, he would love to wander and sunbathe in your home. Come visit Alaska today to see if he just might be the cat for you!</p>

            <h2>Asher</h2>
            <h3>Male/Neutered</h3>
            <h3>5 years</h3>
            <p>	
                Asher is a 5 year-old Domestic Shorthair that is a very nice cat, if a bit shy when you first meet him. Once he warms up and gets to know you, you can expect a warm and friendly guy that will be a pleasant fixture in your home. Asher came to us as a stray with a minor injury on his tail, which we're currently treating, so it's likely he will be so happy to finally find his home with you that you'll have your new best friend forever.
                
                If Asher sounds like your kind of cat, why not come visit him today?</p>

            <h2>Bart</h2>
            <h3>Male/Neutered</h3>
            <h3>3 years 7 months</h3>
            <p>	
                Bart is a handsome 3 year-old gentleman who looks especially dapper in his tuxedo coat with white mittens. He's a calm cat who has lived with children, other cats and a dog previously and done very well, and would be a good fit for anyone looking for a great family cat.

He's a friendly and affectionate fellow who would love to meet you and get some pets, and is likely to be a constant cuddle companion while you relax at your favorite comfy spot at home. He's waiting to meet you here at HSHC, why not come meet him today?</p>
